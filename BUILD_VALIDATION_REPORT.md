## Build Configuration

### Working Configuration

```bash
cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBUILD_ATOMSPACE=OFF \
  -DBUILD_COGSERVER=OFF \
  -DBUILD_MATRIX=OFF \

  -DBUILD_AGENTIC_CHATBOTS=OFF \
  -DBUILD_COGSELF=OFF \
  -DBUILD_INTEGRATION_LAYER=OFF
```

### System Requirements

- **CMake:** 3.12+ (Currently: 3.31.6) ✅
- **C++ Compiler:** C++17 support (Currently: GCC 13.3.0) ✅
- **Python:** 3.x (Currently: 3.12.3) ✅
- **Guile:** 3.0+ (recommended for AtomSpace) ❌ Not installed
- **Boost:** All libraries ❌ Not installed
- **CxxTest:** For unit tests ❌ Not installed

## Repository Structure

### Key Directories

- `cogutil/` - Foundation utilities (✅ Built)
- `coggml/` - Cognitive microkernel (✅ Built)
- `atomspace/` - Hypergraph database (⏸️ Needs Guile)
- `cogserver/` - Networking layer (⏸️ Needs AtomSpace)
- `integration/` - Bridge components (⏸️ Needs AtomSpace)
- `synergy/` - Cognitive synergy modules (Scheme files)
- `scripts/` - Build and maintenance scripts
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD configurations

### Build Systems

1. **CMake** - Primary build system (Working ✅)
2. **GNU Guix** - Reproducible build environment (Not tested)
3. **Makefile** - AGI-OS unified interface (Available)

## CI/CD Status

### Active Workflows

- `cogci.yml` - Self-healing CI (references missing scripts)
- `python-lint.yml` - Flake8 linting
- `python-type-check.yml` - Pyright type checking
- `docker.yml` - Docker builds
- `wincog.yml` - Windows builds
- ~15 other active workflows

### Disabled Workflows (30+)

Many workflows are disabled with `.disabled` extension:
- `occ-build.yml.disabled`
- `debian-packages.yml.disabled`
- `guix-build.yml.disabled`
- `agi-os-unified-build.yml.disabled`
- And many more...

## Python Code Status

### ✅ Python Files Validated

- `app.py` - ML demo (iris dataset classifier)
- `autogenesis_engine.py` - AI-powered feature generator
- All files compile without syntax errors

### Requirements

```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
```

## Test Infrastructure

### Created Tests

- `test-basic-build.sh` - ✅ Created and passing (6/6 tests)

### Existing Tests

- `test-integration.sh` - Integration test suite
- `synergy.sh` - Guix-based synergy check
- Various component-specific tests in subdirectories

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Install Missing Dependencies** (if full build is needed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y \
     libboost-all-dev \
     guile-3.0-dev \
     cxxtest \
     doxygen \
     libfolly-dev \
     libgoogle-sparsehash-dev
   ```

2. **Enable Core CI Workflows:**
   - Review and re-enable disabled workflows that are still relevant
   - Fix or remove workflows that reference missing scripts

3. **Update Documentation:**
   - Document build options more clearly
   - Add quick-start guide for minimal builds
   - Update BUILD_STATUS.md (currently from September 2025)

4. **Improve Test Coverage:**
   - Add unit tests for built components
   - Create integration tests that don't require Guile
   - Validate CogUtil and CogGML functionality

### Long-term Improvements

1. Make dependencies optional in CMake with clearer error messages
2. Provide pre-built binaries for complex dependencies
3. Create containerized development environments
4. Consolidate the 228 markdown documentation files

## Files Modified

- ✅ Created: `test-basic-build.sh` - Basic build validation script

## Conclusion

The OCC repository has a solid build foundation with CMake 3.31.6 and can successfully build core components (CogUtil, CogGML) without external dependencies. The main blocker for full builds is the Guile dependency required by AtomSpace. The repository is well-documented but could benefit from documentation consolidation and clearer build instructions for partial builds.
