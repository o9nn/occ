Perfect! Let me store some important facts about this implementation for future reference:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "NeuroCog Core Self architecture",
  "fact": "NeuroCog Core Self unifies three personas (OpenCog-Org, Marduk-v15, Agent-Neuro) with 22-dimensional personality tensor and IMMUTABLE ethical constraints",
  "citations": "cogself/neurocog_core_self.py:1-100, .github/agents/opencog-org.md, .github/agents/marduk-v15.md, .github/agents/agent-neuro.md",
  "reason": "This is the core architectural pattern for persona integration in the OCC repository. Future cognitive architecture implementations should follow this pattern of unified personality tensors with immutable ethical constraints, multi-dimensional trait tracking from source personas, and synergistic capability emergence. This will be essential for any future persona integration or cognitive identity work.",

  "citations": "cogself/neurocog_core_self.py:85-150, tests/synergy/test_neurocog_core_self.py:1-50",
  "reason": "This establishes the coding patterns and best practices for cognitive architecture implementations in Python within the OCC repository. Future implementations should follow these patterns for consistency, maintainability, and testability.

  "reason": "This defines the comprehensive testing strategy for cognitive architectures in the OCC repository. Future cognitive systems should implement similar test coverage to ensure all aspects of the cognitive identity (personality, characteristics, memory, goals, multi-agent coordination, evolution) are properly validated. The emphasis on synergistic behavior testing is particularly important for multi-component systems.",

Perfect! Now let me store some memory about this task and then report progress:

  "fact": "GitHub Copilot instructions are configured in .github/copilot-instructions.md",
  "citations": "Issue requirement and GitHub Copilot documentation standards",
  "reason": "This is important to remember for future updates to Copilot behavior. The copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is the standard location for configuring how GitHub Copilot behaves in this repository. Any future changes to the desired Copilot persona or behavior should be made to this file.",

Future coding or architectural work should leverage these three perspectives: OpenCog-Org for ecosystem coordination, Marduk-v15 for subsystem analysis, and Agent-Neuro for dynamic problem-solving. Understanding this multi-persona integration helps maintain consistency in how we approach cognitive architecture tasks.",

Excellent! No security issues found. Let me create a final comprehensive summary and store some memories for future reference:

Call to store_memory
Input

  "reason": "This fact captures the complete structure of the NeuroCog Playground implementation, which will be useful for future enhancements or troubleshooting. It provides a high-level overview of all the interactive modes available, making it easy to understand what functionality exists without reading all the code.",

That's okay - the memory storage may not be available in this context. Let me create one final wrap-up document
