## Features Implemented

### 1. Cross-Modal Cognitive Fusion ✅

**Emergent Capability:** `unified_cognitive_processing`

Integrates reasoning (PLN), learning (MOSES), and memory (AtomSpace) into unified cognitive loops with:
- Shared representation layer
- Bidirectional feedback (PLN↔MOSES)
- Meta-learning system
- Strategy evolution

**Files:**
- Implementation: `synergy/bridges/cognitive_fusion_bridge.py` (681 lines)
- Tests: `tests/synergy/test_cognitive_fusion_bridge.py` (24 tests)
- Docs: `docs/cross-modal-cognitive-fusion.md`

### 2. Distributed Cognitive Shard Network ✅

**Emergent Capability:** `distributed_cognition`

Network of specialized cognitive shards (9 types) with:
- Thread-safe shared AtomSpace view
- Inter-shard communication (direct/broadcast/pub-sub)
- Dynamic task allocation
- Load balancing

**Files:**
- Implementation: `synergy/bridges/distributed_shard_network.py` (710 lines)
- Tests: `tests/synergy/test_distributed_shard_network.py` (23 tests)
- Docs: `docs/distributed-cognitive-shard-network.md`

---

## Test Results

- **Total Tests:** 47
- **Pass Rate:** 100%
- **Execution Time:** ~5 seconds
- **Coverage:** Unit, integration, and thread-safety tests

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Rank #6)
**Inference-Driven Pattern Discovery:**
- Define semantic pattern constraints in PLN
- Integrate miner with inference engine
- Add pattern validation via reasoning

### Future Work
- Architectural Autogenesis (Rank #3)
- GPU-Accelerated Hypergraph Inference (Rank #4)

## Documentation Updates

- ✅ Created `docs/cross-modal-cognitive-fusion.md`
- ✅ Created `docs/distributed-cognitive-shard-network.md`
- ✅ Updated `autogenesis_report.md` with implementation status
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with new capabilities
