This vcpkg installation is part of the OCC monorepo and does not
contain git history. To update vcpkg, run the update script:
  ./third_party/update-vcpkg.sh

Source: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg

Integration Method:
1. Cloned with --depth 1 (shallow clone)
2. Removed .git directory
3. Integrated as regular folder in monorepo

Benefits:
- No network dependency during builds
- Deterministic builds across all environments
- Full control over vcpkg updates
- Faster CI/CD builds (no vcpkg clone step)
