Description: OpenCog Probabilistic Logic Network
 Probabilistic Logic Network, or PLN for short, is a logic invented by
 Ben Goertzel et al for common sense reasoning. It is particularly well
 suited for uncertain reasoning, especially when knowledge is based on limited
 observations from reality, but can also handle abstract mathematical
 reasoning, and the relationship between the two.
 .
 To handle uncertainty PLN represents truth as a second order distribution,
 i.e. a probabilistic distribution over probabilistic distributions. Doing so
 allows one to capture uncertainty while remaining in the well known and
 proven framework of probability theory.
 .
 Key features include:
  - Uncertain inference with confidence intervals
  - Induction, deduction, abduction, and analogy
  - Higher-order inference and meta-reasoning
  - Integration with the Unified Rule Engine (URE)
  - Truth value mathematics for probabilistic reasoning
  - Support for both crisp and fuzzy logic
  - Cognitive synergy with attention allocation and learning
 .
 PLN is a core component of the OpenCog AGI framework and enables the
 system to reason under uncertainty, learn from limited data, and perform
 common-sense reasoning. It is used in applications including bioinformatics,
 natural language understanding, and autonomous systems.
