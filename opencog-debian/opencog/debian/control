Description: framework for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
 OpenCog is a framework for developing AI systems, especially appropriate for
 integrative multi-algorithm systems, and artificial general intelligence
 systems. Though much work remains to be done, it currently contains a
 functional core framework, and a number of cognitive agents at varying
 levels of completion, some already displaying interesting and useful
 functionalities alone and in combination.
 .
 This meta-package installs the complete OpenCog Collection, including:
  - AtomSpace: Hypergraph knowledge representation system
  - PLN: Probabilistic Logic Networks for uncertain reasoning
  - URE: Unified Rule Engine for forward and backward chaining
  - ECAN: Economic Attention Networks for attention allocation
  - Pattern Miner: Frequent pattern discovery in knowledge graphs
  - Language Learning: Unsupervised grammar induction
  - MOSES: Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search
  - Vision: Visual perception and object recognition
  - CogServer: Network server for distributed AtomSpace access
 .
 OpenCog is designed for cognitive synergy, where the interaction of diverse
 AI components produces emergent intelligence beyond individual algorithms.
 It is used in research areas including natural language understanding,
 bioinformatics, robotics, and autonomous systems.
 .
 The framework supports multiple programming languages (C++, Python, Scheme,
 Haskell) and provides both symbolic and sub-symbolic AI capabilities,
 enabling integration of logic, learning, and evolutionary optimization.
