Description: Direct AtomSpace integration at HurdCog kernel level
 This package provides the MachSpace abstraction layer, enabling direct
 AtomSpace hypergraph integration within the HurdCog cognitive operating
 system kernel layer.
 .
 MachSpace implements an AtomSpace-compatible interface that allows
 kernel-level services and system translators to participate in cognitive
 operations without requiring full application-level AtomSpace instantiation.
 .
 Key features include:
  - Shared memory hypergraph storage for efficient knowledge sharing
  - Copy-on-write atom management for large knowledge bases
  - Message-passing integration through Mach IPC mechanism
  - Kernel-level attention allocation and propagation
  - Zero-copy atom transfer between processes
  - Efficient serialization for cross-layer communication
 .
 This package is essential for the AGI-OS architecture, providing the
 critical bridge between microkernel primitives and hypergraph knowledge
 representation.
