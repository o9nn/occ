Description: Unified monitoring and telemetry for AGI-OS stack
 This package provides comprehensive monitoring and visualization tools
 for the entire AGI Operating System stack, from the Cognumach microkernel
 through HurdCog to the OpenCog Collection application layer.
 .
 The monitoring system offers real-time observation of cognitive processes,
 attention flow tracking, knowledge graph evolution, and system-wide
 performance metrics. It integrates data from all three layers of the
 AGI-OS architecture to provide a unified view of system behavior.
 .
 Key features include:
  - Real-time cognitive process visualization
  - Attention flow tracking across all system layers
  - Knowledge graph evolution monitoring
  - System-wide performance metrics and resource usage
  - Tensor Thread Fiber execution tracking
  - Ontogenetic Loom activity monitoring
  - Web-based dashboard with interactive visualizations
  - REST API for programmatic access to metrics
  - Alert system for cognitive anomalies
  - Historical data analysis and trend visualization
 .
 The monitoring system is essential for understanding, debugging, and
 optimizing the behavior of the AGI-OS.
