Description: Cognitive-aware process scheduler for Cognumach microkernel
 This package implements a cognitive-aware process scheduler that extends
 the standard Mach scheduler with attention-based CPU allocation and
 learning-based scheduling policies.
 .
 The cognitive scheduler enables the Cognumach microkernel to allocate
 CPU time based not only on traditional priority metrics but also on
 cognitive attention values and reasoning importance. This allows the
 AGI-OS to prioritize cognitive workloads dynamically based on their
 current relevance to system goals.
 .
 Key features include:
  - Attention-based CPU allocation
  - Learning-based scheduling policies that adapt over time
  - Cognitive workload detection and classification
  - Priority adaptation based on reasoning importance
  - Integration with MachSpace for attention value access
  - Support for Tensor Thread Fiber scheduling
 .
 This package is a critical component of the AGI-OS architecture,
 enabling cognitive-aware resource management at the microkernel level.
