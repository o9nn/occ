Description: Very low-level C++ programming utilities library for OpenCog
 The OpenCog utilities is a miscellaneous collection of C++ utilities used for
 typical programming tasks in multiple OpenCog projects.
 .
 This library provides foundational utilities including:
  - Logger: Thread-safe logging with multiple severity levels
  - Config: Configuration file management
  - Concurrent: Thread-safe data structures and utilities
  - Exceptions: Exception handling framework
  - Backtrace: Stack trace generation for debugging
  - Platform: Cross-platform compatibility utilities
 .
 CogUtil serves as Layer 1 in the OpenCog stack and is required by all
 other OpenCog components. It has no OpenCog-specific dependencies and
 can be used as a standalone C++ utility library.
