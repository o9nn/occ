Description: Cognitive initialization and bootstrap services for AGI-OS
 This package provides intelligent initialization and bootstrap services
 for the AGI Operating System, enabling the system to start up with
 cognitive awareness and adapt its configuration based on hardware
 capabilities and system goals.
 .
 Unlike traditional init systems that follow fixed startup sequences,
 the cognitive init system can reason about service dependencies,
 prioritize initialization based on attention values, and adapt the
 startup process based on learned patterns and system state.
 .
 Key features include:
  - Cognitive-aware system startup and initialization
  - Initial knowledge base loading and validation
  - Cognitive service orchestration and dependency resolution
  - Self-configuration based on hardware capabilities
  - Adaptive startup sequence based on learned patterns
  - Integration with Ontogenetic Looms for system evolution
  - Attention-based service prioritization
  - Graceful degradation when components are unavailable
  - Boot-time reasoning for optimal configuration
  - Integration with systemd for compatibility
 .
 This package enables the AGI-OS to exhibit intelligent behavior from
 the moment of system startup, rather than requiring manual configuration
 or fixed initialization sequences.
