Description: OpenCog hypergraph database, query system and rule engine
 The OpenCog AtomSpace is a knowledge representation (KR) database and
 the associated query/reasoning engine to fetch and manipulate that data,
 and perform reasoning on it. Data is represented in the form of graphs, and
 more generally, as hypergraphs; thus the AtomSpace is a kind of graph
 database, the query engine is a general graph re-writing system, and
 the rule-engine is a generalized rule-driven inferencing system.
 .
 The vertices and edges of a graph, known as "Atoms", are used to represent
 not only "data", but also "procedures"; thus, many graphs are executable
 programs as well as data structures.
 .
 Key features include:
  - Distributed hypergraph knowledge representation
  - Pattern matching and graph rewriting
  - Truth value system with probabilistic reasoning
  - Attention allocation mechanisms
  - Multi-language bindings (C++, Python, Scheme, Haskell)
  - Persistent storage backends (RocksDB, PostgreSQL, CogServer)
  - Type system with inheritance and composition
  - Value system for efficient numeric and tensor operations
 .
 AtomSpace serves as Layer 2 in the OpenCog stack and is the foundation
 for all cognitive algorithms including PLN, ECAN, pattern mining, and
 language learning. It enables cognitive synergy through unified knowledge
 representation across diverse AI paradigms.
