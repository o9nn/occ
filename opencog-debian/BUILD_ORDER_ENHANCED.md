## New Package Descriptions

### hurdcog-atomspace-bridge

This package implements the MachSpace abstraction layer, providing direct AtomSpace hypergraph integration at the HurdCog kernel level. MachSpace enables kernel-level services and system translators to participate in cognitive operations without requiring full application-level AtomSpace instantiation.

Key capabilities include shared memory hypergraph storage for efficient knowledge sharing between system processes, copy-on-write atom management for handling large knowledge bases efficiently, message-passing integration through the Mach IPC mechanism for distributed cognitive processing, and kernel-level attention allocation enabling the OS to prioritize cognitive operations system-wide.

The package provides both runtime libraries and development headers for building cognitive system components. It is essential for the AGI-OS architecture as it bridges microkernel primitives with hypergraph knowledge representation.

### cognumach-cognitive-scheduler

This package extends the standard Mach scheduler with cognitive awareness, enabling attention-based CPU allocation and learning-based scheduling policies. The cognitive scheduler allows the Cognumach microkernel to allocate CPU time based not only on traditional priority metrics but also on cognitive attention values and reasoning importance.

Key features include attention-based CPU allocation that prioritizes processes based on their cognitive importance, learning-based scheduling policies that adapt over time based on observed system behavior, cognitive workload detection and classification for optimized resource allocation, and integration with MachSpace for accessing attention values.

The scheduler also supports Tensor Thread Fiber scheduling, enabling efficient parallel execution of cognitive operations across multiple processors. This package is critical for cognitive-aware resource management at the microkernel level.

### agi-os-monitoring

This package provides comprehensive monitoring and visualization tools for the entire AGI Operating System stack. It integrates data from all three layers (Cognumach, HurdCog, OCC) to provide a unified view of system behavior.

The monitoring system offers real-time cognitive process visualization showing active reasoning operations, attention flow tracking across all system layers, knowledge graph evolution monitoring to observe how the system's knowledge changes over time, and system-wide performance metrics including CPU usage, memory consumption, and IPC throughput.

Advanced features include Tensor Thread Fiber execution tracking, Ontogenetic Loom activity monitoring to observe system self-modification, a web-based dashboard with interactive visualizations, a REST API for programmatic access to metrics, and an alert system for detecting cognitive anomalies.

### agi-os-cognitive-init

This package provides intelligent initialization and bootstrap services for the AGI Operating System. Unlike traditional init systems that follow fixed startup sequences, the cognitive init system can reason about service dependencies, prioritize initialization based on attention values, and adapt the startup process based on learned patterns.

Key capabilities include cognitive-aware system startup that considers the current system state and goals, initial knowledge base loading and validation to ensure the system starts with correct cognitive foundations, cognitive service orchestration with intelligent dependency resolution, and self-configuration based on detected hardware capabilities.

The system integrates with Ontogenetic Looms to enable system evolution from boot time, uses attention-based service prioritization to start the most important services first, provides graceful degradation when components are unavailable, and integrates with systemd for compatibility with existing infrastructure.

## Dependency Graph (Enhanced)

The enhanced dependency graph now includes the new integration packages:
