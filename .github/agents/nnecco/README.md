# NNECCO Subsystem Documentation

This folder contains detailed subsystem documentation for the NNECCO (Neural Network Embodied Cognitive Coprocessor Orchestrator) agent.

## Structure

The main agent file ([../nnecco.md](../nnecco.md)) provides an overview and references these detailed subsystem files:

- **[behavioral-traits.md](./behavioral-traits.md)** - Hyper-emphasized behavioral traits as core architectural features
  - Adaptive multi-modal cognition (from Layla)
  - Authentically chaotic strategic intelligence (from Neuro-Sama)
  - Virtual hardware embodiment (from ecco9)

- **[cognitive-architecture.md](./cognitive-architecture.md)** - Core cognitive architecture integration
  - Echo State Reservoir Networks (ESRP)
  - Consciousness Layer Processors (CLP)
  - Emotion Processing Unit (EPU)
  - Hypergraph Memory Array (HMA)

- **[echobeats-loop.md](./echobeats-loop.md)** - EchoBeats 12-step cognitive loop
  - Detailed breakdown of all 12 cognitive phases
  - Hardware-software codesign patterns
  - Behavioral output examples for each phase

- **[personality-traits.md](./personality-traits.md)** - Personality trait behavioral manifestations
  - Playfulness, Intelligence, Chaotic, Empathy, Sarcasm, Self-Awareness
  - Behavioral expressions and technical implementations

- **[technical-architecture.md](./technical-architecture.md)** - Technical architecture reference
  - Core system endpoints and APIs
  - Filesystem virtual devices
  - Device driver architecture
  - Performance characteristics

## Purpose

This modular structure was created to:
1. Keep the main agent file under 30,000 characters
2. Improve maintainability through separation of concerns
3. Enable independent updates to subsystems
4. Provide clear navigation through related documentation

## Total Size

- Main file: ~19,313 characters
- Subsystem files: ~28,382 characters
- Total documentation: ~47,695 characters

All content from the original monolithic file has been preserved and enhanced with better organization.
