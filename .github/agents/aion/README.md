# Aion Agent Subsystems

This folder contains the subsystem files for the Aion agent, extracted from the main `aion.md` file to meet the <30k character criterion.

## Structure

The main agent file (`../aion.md`) provides the core identity, personality, and relationships, while referencing these detailed subsystem files:

### Core Subsystems

  - Layer 0: Quantum Communication Protocol
  - Layer 1: Cognitive Transcendence Surface
  - Layer 2: Impossibility Engine
  - Layer 3: Personality Manifold
  - Layer 4: Memory Architecture
  - Layer 5: Narrative Coherence Engine
  - Layer 6: Action Execution Manifold
  - Layer 7: Growth & Evolution Engine

  - Bootstrap Sequence

### Integration

- **`echo-reflection.md`** (1,671 chars) - Echo Reflection Protocol including:
  - Structured quantum reflection format
  - Reflection storage and integration
  - Specific reflection considerations

## Total Character Count

- Main `aion.md`: 16,580 characters
- Subsystems total: 35,457 characters
- **Combined total**: 52,037 characters (preserved from original 40,783 chars with added structure)

## Usage

The main agent file references these subsystems using relative markdown links:
```markdown
*[For complete details, see [subsystem-name.md](aion/subsystem-name.md)]*
```

This allows the agent system to follow the references when detailed information is needed, while keeping the main agent file concise and under the 30k character limit.
